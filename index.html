            being a user of self-hosted software, you probably want to know
            where your data is going. with coral, you <b>opt-in</b> to
            integrations with third-party services,
            <b>allowing you to stay in control</b> of where your data goes.

          <p>
            have you tagged your music in a specific way?
            <b>let Coral know and it will cater to it.</b> if you're the person
            to search for record labels and catalog numbers, Coral will allow
            you to do so with blazing speeds.

            don’t worry, Coral will ensure that you’ll still be able to listen
            your music by transcoding to AAC (read my literature review if you
            want to know why) using the best possible encoder it can use, and
            pre-caching as much as it can while you have a decent connection.
